## About Me
My research focuses on women's reproductive health and technology. In particular, I examine communication of women's health issues and digital technology for women's health and well-being. I use quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods, including surveys, experiments, interviews, and big data analytics. In my free time, I enjoy taking walks with my dog and exploring LA.
