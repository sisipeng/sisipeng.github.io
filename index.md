## About Me
My research focuses on women's health and technology. In particular, I have been examining knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to reproductive health. I use quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods, including surveys, experiments, interviews, and content analysis. In my free time, I enjoy taking walks with my dog and baking sweet treats.
